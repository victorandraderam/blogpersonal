  abstract = {Chilean consumer law and policy has a short but enthralling history. As compared with other jurisdictions such as EU countries, its bedrock is still in formation, particularly pertaining to its envisaged role in the regulatory spectrum applicable to consumer markets. However, this circumstance has not been a serious obstacle to several reforms carried out in recent years aimed at broadening its scope of action, including rethinking a proposal regarding the policy goals to be addressed by the national consumer agency, SERNAC. In that context, this article presents a brief account of the main features of Chilean consumer law, considering the current socioeconomic development level of the country, the main pieces of legislation concerning consumer protection in the Chilean legal framework---notably the Chilean Consumer Protection Act---as well as key elements of the public policy approach in this matter. A few examples of topics such as product liability and sale and purchase of consumer goods are also analysed in order to allow a comparison of the Chilean experience in consumer protection with other jurisdictions.},

  abstract = {Credit cards have a complex nature, or better said, as complex as issuers wish it to be. Fractional annual fees or recurring charges, charges per event, late fees, prepaid fees, segmented credit lines, loyalty programs, exclusive promotions, cash advances, and consolidated loans in the event of a minimum payment, are all concepts that, although present in the daily operations of a credit card, can hardly be considered holistically in the decision of contracting or using a particular credit card instead of another. "Sernac Financiero" means the policy and institutional response to the harmful effects of massification of financial products, in which the main regulatory technique to protect consumers is the use of duties of information. In this paper we critically review the above option regarding its suitability as a mechanism for achieving adequate financial consumer protection, concluding that its implementation should be improved by taking into account recent findings in the field of behavioral economics. Similarly, weighing the inherent dogmatism of legal economic theories we see the need to expand the current regulatory spectrum, with the aim of taking stronger measures, such as minimum contract content rules and legal prohibitions.},
