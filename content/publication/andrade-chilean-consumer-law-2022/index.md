abstract: Chilean consumer law and policy has a short but enthralling history. As
  compared with other jurisdictions such as EU countries, its bedrock is still in
  formation, particularly pertaining to its envisaged role in the regulatory spectrum
  applicable to consumer markets. However, this circumstance has not been a serious
  obstacle to several reforms carried out in recent years aimed at broadening its
  scope of action, including rethinking a proposal regarding the policy goals to be
  addressed by the national consumer agency, SERNAC. In that context, this article
  presents a brief account of the main features of Chilean consumer law, considering
  the current socioeconomic development level of the country, the main pieces of legislation
  concerning consumer protection in the Chilean legal framework---notably the Chilean
  Consumer Protection Act---as well as key elements of the public policy approach
  in this matter. A few examples of topics such as product liability and sale and
  purchase of consumer goods are also analysed in order to allow a comparison of the
  Chilean experience in consumer protection with other jurisdictions.
